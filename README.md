# Android-Application-Penetration-Testing
To explore and apply ethical hacking techniques to assess the security of Android  mobile applications. The project aims to identify vulnerabilities such as insecure data  storage, weak authentication mechanisms, and exploitable code, helping developers  strengthen mobile app security.  

# Tools & Environment: 
- Burp Suite
- MobSF (Mobile Security Framework)
- ApkTool
- Android Studio
- Frida 
- JADX
- OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)
   
# Key Work Done: 
- Collected and prepared target APKs for penetration testing. 
-  Performed static analysis (decompiling APKs, inspecting code, checking for 
hardcoded secrets, permissions, and insecure configurations). 
- Conducted dynamic analysis (runtime behavior testing, API endpoint monitoring, 
and reverse engineering). 
- Used Frida and Burp Suite to simulate real-world attacks such as insecure API 
calls and session hijacking. 
- Mapped vulnerabilities to OWASP Mobile Top 10 threats. 
- Suggested remediations and secure coding practices for discovered flaws.  

# Outcome: 
Identified multiple security flaws across test applications, including improper data 
handling and insecure communications. Delivered a detailed vulnerability assessment 
report and recommended best practices to improve mobile app security. The project 
provides a practical guide for developers and testers to adopt an attackerâ€™s mindset and 
secure Android apps more effectively.
